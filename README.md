# Welcome to DeFi Watch

**DeFi Watch** is a blockchain-agnostic project dedicated to monitoring and reporting centralization risks associated with decentralized finance protcols, products and applications.

The goal is to build a more resilient and bulletproof DeFi ecosystem while also educating end-users as to the not-so-obvious risks of using nascent DeFi tools.

The project is founded and maintained by [Chris Blec](https://twitter.com/chrisblec) and welcomes contributions from the community. 

This is a curated site. Contributions are welcome but will be merged at the discretion of the owner.
